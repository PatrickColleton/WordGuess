    <h2>Hint:</h2>
    <p>You want a hint? Ok, I'll give you one. (*flicks cigarette to the ground*) It's apt this game is called Hangman, you know. Each day we merely stare
      into the void deluding ourselves that our decisions mean something. We live in a universe of emptiness and dust,
      and our whole existence is predicated on denying that emptiness until we, and everyone and everything we ever loved, become
      part of it. Our true nature is oblivion. We are all Dorian Gray but our portraits are on obscene display for
      all to see. This is a fun game for the whole family. Please be sure to only guess one letter at a time :)</p>
